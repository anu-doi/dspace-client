ANU Press Titles 1965 to 1991,Sino-Soviet relations,ANU Press,1971,Open Access,Book,The first phase 1917-1920,"This study seeks to shed light on one of the mysteries of modern
Chinese history—that of the Karakhan Manifesto. This remarkable
document—addressed to the Chinese by the Soviet
Commissariat of Foreign Affairs in 1919—pledged the new
Soviet Government to restore to China the rights and privileges
forcibly extracted by Tsarism. Shortly afterwards the Chinese
were told that the text they had received, containing a promise
to restore unconditionally to China the Chinese Eastern Railway
and other Russian possessions in Manchuria, was not authentic
and another version was forwarded. This monograph discusses
the problems of the different versions and the Chinese Government’s
apparent ignoring of the manifesto. The author’s conclusions
on this intriguing problem will interest scholars of
Soviet policy, both foreign and domestic, Sino-Soviet relations,
and modern Chinese history.","Sow-Theng, Leong","FitzGerald, Stephen",12345,6789,Press Archive,Sino_Soviet_Relations_b14125067.pdf
ANU Press Titles 1965 to 1991,Lang and socialism,ANU Press,1971,Open Access,Book,A study in the great depression,"The Great Depression is a significant
but neglected period in Australian
history. This book describes the
formation within the New South
Wales Labor Party of a massorganised
ginger group, known as the
Socialisation Units, which tried to
convert the Party to 'socialism in our
time'.
The group became so strong that
it was in effect a party within the
Party. At the 1931 Easter Conference
it succeeded in committing the Labor
Party to a positive policy of socialism.
Although the decision was later
revised, it remains unique in the
history of Australian Labor Parties.
Throughout the period of the
Socialisation Units, J.T. Lang presided
over the New South Wales Labor Party
as charismatic leader and machine
boss. We read of his Inner Group's
effort to contain the Units through
Party management, of the defeat of
the Socialisation Units after a struggle
for power within the Party, and of the
subsequent loss to the Labor Party of
many young idealists who had been
attracted by the Units.
For those interested in Australian
history and politics in the twentieth
century this book will colour in a
period so far only dimly sketched, and
a political leader still seen as a hero or
villain of the Great Depression.","Cooksey, Robert",,12345,6789,Press Archive,Lang_and_Socialism_b12294196.pdf
ANU Press Titles 1965 to 1991,Midsummer eve's dream,ANU Press,1970,Open Access,Book,Variations on a thembe by William Dunbar,"What kind of people lived in Scotland in the
Middle Ages? The author has some surprising
answers to this question, one of the many he found
himself contemplating when he decided to look
into the background of 'The Tretis of the Tua
Mariit Wemen and the Wedo’ by the fifteenthcentury
Scottish poet, William Dunbar. The poem
concerns three lovely women, discovered conversing
in a grove on Midsummer Eve. Two are dissatisfied
with their husbands, the third dispenses outspoken
advice on the way sensible women should regard
the institution of marriage.
Hope wanted to reconstruct the background to
this entertaining and splendidly written piece, and
his research led him along a number of intriguing
paths. The fairy cult in Britain, and particularly in
medieval Scotland, had a special fascination for him,
as did the unusual sexual customs of the Scots.
Both subjects are important in the elucidation of
Dunbar’s poem: perhaps the ladies are fairies, or
related to the goddesses of the early Celts;
perhaps they are ordinary Edinburgh housewives.
The book is a piece of serious scholarship—with
a difference. It was written, as the author says,
for the sheer pleasure of following up odd pieces
of information, and the chief aim of this tapestry
of folklore, history, philosophy, and literature
^ is to entertain.","Hope, A.D.",,12345,6789,Press Archive,Midsummer_Eves_Dream_b15317882.pdf

ANU Press Titles 1965 to 1991,Remote aborigines,ANU Press,1971,Open Access,Book,Aborigines in australian society,"This last book of Professor Rowley’s trilogy
on Aboriginal Policy and Practice deals
with the situation of the ‘full-blood’
Aborigines in the centre and north of
Australia. The author refers to this area as
‘colonial Australia’, offering reasons
including the restrictions on movement by
the Aborigines, with the resultant emphasis
on mission and government ‘settlements’;
the much lower wages paid to Aborigines in
the area; the withholding of social service
benefits which other Australians may obtain
easily; and the power vested in officials and
missionaries to control Aborigines.
Professor Rowley argues that, in the remote
areas, policy and practice of government
must be altered fundamentally, otherwise
the last remnants of the tribes will be
reduced to the situation described in
Outcasts in White Australia.
Like Rowley’s other two books, this one is
an indictment of white Australian
indifference to the maltreatment of an
inarticulate minority. His basic argument is
that no policy can now succeed without
reconciliation; that governments, after two
centuries, must come at last to negotiate
with the Aborigines. It is also argued that
even now it may not be too late to learn
from the Aboriginal how to see and
appreciate the continent in which we live.
But this is an issue which demands some
humility from non-Aboriginal Australians.","Rowley, C.D.",,12345,6789,Press Archive,Remote_Aborigines_b12160519.pdf
